For this challenge, we hashed the flag to bother you so here's the md5 hash:fa8fea5c6db6848d1d85502cfd7ff486 But we are going to give you some hints, the word inside the curly brackets {} is 5 characters long, it has only two capital letter, one lowercase, one number and one character from this string "@_-/".

Good luck !
