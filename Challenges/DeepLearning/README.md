Classify each image in the "flag" directory. Each prediction of a dog or cat (0 or 1) will correspond to a black or white pixel. To reconstruct the flag, use the coordinates included in the image name.

For example, the prediction for image 78_6.jpg will be written as a pixel at coordinates row 78, column 6.
