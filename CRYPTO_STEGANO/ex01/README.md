For this challenge, we hashed the flag to bother you so here's the md5 hash:a89545baa983c7b8c572e589d840bc33
But we are going to give you some hints, the word inside the curly brackets {} is 5 characters long, it has only one capital letter, two lowercase, one number and one character from this string "@_-/\".
Good luck !
